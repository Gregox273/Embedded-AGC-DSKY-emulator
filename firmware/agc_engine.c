 * Filename:	agc_engine.c
 * Purpose:	This is the main engine for binary simulation of the Apollo AGC
 *  		computer.  It is separate from the Display/Keyboard (DSKY)
 *  		simulation and Apollo hardware simulation, though compatible
 *  		with them.  The executable binary may be created using the
 *  		yayul (Yet Another YUL) assembler.
 * Compiler:	GNU gcc.
 * Contact:	Ron Burkey <info@sandroid.org>

 * Mods:	04/05/03 RSB.	Began.
 *   		08/20/03 RSB.	Now bitmasks are handled on input channels.
 *   		11/26/03 RSB.	Up to now, a pseudo-linear space was used to
 *   				model internal AGC memory.  This was simply too
 *   				tricky to work with, because it was too hard to
 *   				understand the address conversions that were
 *   				taking place.  I now use a banked model much
 *   				closer to the true AGC memory map.
 *   		11/28/03 RSB.	Added code for a bunch of instruction types,
 *   				and fixed a bunch of bugs.
 *   		11/29/03 RSB.	Finished out all of the instruction types.
 *   				Still a lot of uncertainty if Overflow
 *   				and/or editing has been handled properly.
 *   				Undoubtedly many bugs.
 *   		05/01/04 RSB	Now makes sure that in --debug-dsky mode
 *   				doesn't execute any AGC code (since there
 *   				isn't any loaded anyhow).
 *   		05/03/04 RSB	Added a workaround for "TC Q".  It's not
 *   				right, but it has to be more right than
 *   				what was there before.
 *   		05/04/04 RSB	Fixed a bug in CS, where the unused bit
 *   				could get set and therefore mess up
 *   				later comparisons.  Fixed an addressing bug
 *   				(was 10-bit but should have been 12-bit) in
 *   				the AD instruction.  DCA was completely
 *   				messed up (still don't know about overflow).
 *   		05/05/04 RSB	INDEX'ing was messed up because the pending
 *				index was zeroed before being completely
 *				used up.  Fixed the "CCS A" instruction.
 *				Fixed CCS in the case of negative compare-
 *				values.
 *		05/06/04 RSB	Added rfopen.  The operation of "DXCH L"
 *				(which is ambiguous in the docs but actually
 *				used --- at Luminary131 address 33,03514) ---
 *				has been redefined in accordance with the
 *				Luminary program's comments.  Adjusted
 *				"CS A" and "CA A", though I don't actually
 *				think they work differently.  Fixed a
 *				potential divide-by-0 in DV.
 *		05/10/04 RSB	Fixed up i/o channel operations so that they
 *				properly use AGC-formatted integers rather
 *				than the simulator's native-format integers.
 *		05/12/04 RSB	Added the data collection for backtraces.
 *		05/13/04 RSB	Corrected calculation of the superbank address.
 *		05/14/04 RSB	Added interrupt service and hopefully fixed the
 *				RESUME instruction.  Fixed a bunch of instructions
 *				(but not all, since I couldn't figure out how to
 *				consistently do it) that modify the Z register.
 *		05/15/04 RSB	Repaired the interrupt vector and the RESUME
 *				instruction, so that they do not automatically
 *				save/restore A, L, Q, and BB to/from
 *				ARUPUT, LRUPT, QRUPT, and BBRUPT.  The ISR
 *				is supposed to do that itself, if it wants
 *				it done. And (sigh!) the RESUME instruction
 *				wasn't working, but was treated as INDEX 017.
 *		05/17/04 RSB	Added MasterInterruptEnable.  Added updates of
 *				timer-registers TIME1 and TIME2, of TIME3 and
 *				TIME4, and of SCALER1 and SCALER2.
 *		05/18/04 RSB	The mask used for writing to channel 7 have
 *				changed from 0100 to 0160, because the
 *				Luminary131 source (p.59) claims that bits
 *				5-7 are used.  I don't know what bits 5-6
 *				are for, though.
 *		05/19/04 RSB	I'm beginning to grasp now what to do for
 *				overflow.  The AD instruction (in which
 *				overflow was messed up) and the TS instruction
 *				(which was completely bollixed) have hopefully
 *				been fixed now.
 *		05/30/04 RSB	Now have a spec to work from (my assembly-
 *				language manual).  Working to bring this code
 *				up to v0.50 of the spec.
 *		05/31/04 RSB	The instruction set has basically been completely
 *				rewritten.
 *		06/01/04 RSB	Corrected the indexing of instructions
 *				for negative indices.  Oops!  The instruction
 *				executed on RESUME was taken from BBRUPT
 *				instead of BRUPT.
 *		06/02/04 RSB	Found that I was using an unsigned datatype
 *				for EB, FB, and BB, thus causing comparisons of
 *				them to registers to fail.  Now autozero the
 *				unused bits of EB, FB, and BB.
 *		06/04/04 RSB	Separated ServerStuff function from agc_engine
 *				function.
 *		06/05/04 RSB	Fixed the TCAA, ZQ, and ZL instructions.
 *		06/11/04 RSB	Added a definition for uint16_t in Win32.
 *		06/30/04 RSB	Made SignExtend, AddSP16, and
 *				OverflowCorrected non-static.
 *		07/02/04 RSB	Fixed major bug in SU instruction, in which it
 *				not only used the wrong value, but overwrote
 *				the wrong location.
 *		07/04/04 RSB	Fixed bug (I hope) in converting "decent"
 *				to "DP".  The DAS instruction did not leave the
 *				proper values in the A,L registers.
 *		07/05/04 RSB	Changed DXCH to do overflow-correction on the
 *				accumulator.  Also, the special cases "DXCH A"
 *				and "DXCH L" were being checked improperly
 *				before, and therefore were not treated
 *				properly.
 *		07/07/04 RSB	Some cases of DP arithmetic with the MS word
 *				or LS word being -0 were fixed.
 *		07/08/04 RSB	CA and CS fixed to re-edit after doing their work.
 *				Instead of using the overflow-corrected
 *				accumulator, BZF and BZMF now use the complete
 *				accumulator.  Either positive or negative
 *				overflow blocks BZF, while positive overflow
 *				blocks BZMF.
 *		07/09/04 RSB	The DAS instruction has been completely rewritten
 *				to alter the relative signs of the output.
 *				Previously they were normalized to be identical,
 *				and this is wrong.  In the DV instruction, the
 *				case of remainder==0 needed to be fixed up to
 *				distinguish between +0 and -0.
 *		07/10/04 RSB	Completely replaced MSU.  And ... whoops! ...
 *				forgot to inhibit interrupts while the
 *				accumulator contains overflow.  The special
 *				cases "DCA L" and "DCS L" have been addressed.
 *				"CCS A" has been changed similarly to BZF and
 *				BZMF w.r.t. overflow.
 *		07/12/04 RSB	Q is now 16 bits.
 *		07/15/04 RSB	Pretty massive rewrites:  Data alignment changed
 *				to bit 0 rather than 1.  All registers at
 *				addresses less than REG16 are now 16 bits,
 *				rather than just A and Q.
 *		07/17/04 RSB	The final contents of L with DXCH, DCA, and
 *				DCS are now overflow-corrected.
 *		07/19/04 RSB	Added SocketInterlace/Reload.
 *		08/12/04 RSB	Now account for output ports that are latched
 *				externally, and for updating newly-attached
 *				peripherals with current i/o-port values.
 *		08/13/04 RSB	The Win32 version of yaAGC now recognizes when
 *				socket-disconnects have occurred, and allows
 *				the port to be reused.
 *		08/18/04 RSB	Split off all socket-related stuff into
 *				SocketAPI.c, so that a cleaner API could be
 *				available for integrators.
 *		02/27/05 RSB	Added the license exception, as required by
 *				the GPL, for linking to Orbiter SDK libraries.
 *		05/14/05 RSB	Corrected website references.
 *		05/15/05 RSB	Oops!  The unprogrammed counter increments were
 *				hooked up to i/o space rather than to
 *				erasable.  So incoming counter commands were
 *				ignored.
 *		06/11/05 RSB	Implemented the fictitious output channel 0177
 *				used to make it easier to implement an
 *				emulation of the gyros.
 *		06/12/05 RSB	Fixed the CounterDINC function to emit a
 *				POUT, MOUT, or ZOUT, as it is supposed to.
 *		06/16/05 RSB	Implemented IMU CDU drive output pulses.
 *		06/18/05 RSB	Fixed PINC/MINC at +0 to -1 and -0 to +1
 *				transitions.
 *		06/25/05 RSB	Fixed the DOWNRUPT interrupt requests.
 *		06/30/05 RSB	Hopefully fixed fine-alignment, by making
 *				the gyro torquing depend on the GYROCTR
 *				register as well as elapsed time.
 *		07/01/05 RSB	Replaced the gyro-torquing code, to
 *				avoid simulating the timing of the
 *				3200 pps. pulses, which was conflicting
 *				somehow with the timing Luminary wanted
 *				to impose.
 *		07/02/05 RSB	OPTXCMD & OPTYCMD.
 *		07/04/05 RSB	Fix for writes to channel 033.
 *		08/17/05 RSB	Fixed an embarrassing bug in SpToDecent,
 *				thanks to Christian Bucher.
 *		08/20/05 RSB	I no longer allow interrupts when the
 *				program counter is in the range 0-060.
 *				I do this principally to guard against the
 *				case Z=0,1,2, since I'm not sure that all of
 *				the AGC code saves registers properly in this
 *				case.  Now I inhibit interrupts prior to
 *				INHINT, RELINT, and EXTEND (as we're supposed
 *				to), as well as RESUME (as we're not supposed
 *				to).  The intent of the latter is to take
 *				care of problems that occur when EDRUPT is used.
 *				(Specifically, an interrupt can occur between
 *				RELINT and RESUME after an EDRUPT, and this
 *				messes up the return address in ZRUPT used by
 *				the RESUME.)
 *		08/21/05 RSB	Removed the interrupt inhibition from the
 *				address range 0-060, because it prevented
 *				recovery from certain conditions.
 *		08/28/05 RSB	Oops!  Had been using PINC sequences on
 *				TIME6 rather than DINC sequences.
 *		10/05/05 RSB	FIFOs were introduced for PCDU or MCDU
 *				commands on the registers CDUX, CDUY, CDUZ.
 *				The purpose of these FIFOs is to make sure
 *				that CDUX, CDUY, CDUZ are updated at no
 *				more than an 800 cps rate, in order to
 *				avoid problems with the Kalman filter in the
 *				DAP, which is otherwise likely to reject
 *				counts that change too quickly.
 *		10/07/05 RSB	FIFOs changed from 800 cps to either 400 cps
 *				("low rate") or 6400 cps ("high rate"),
 *				depending on the variable CduHighRate.
 *				At the moment, CduHighRate is stuck at 0,
 *				because we've worked out no way to plausibly
 *				change it.
 *		11/13/05 RSB	Took care of auto-adjust buffer timing for
 *				high-rate and low-rate CDU counter updates.
 *				PCDU/MCDU commands 1/3 are slow mode, and
 *				PCDU/MCDU commands 021/023 are fast mode.
 *		02/26/06 RSB	Oops!  This wouldn't build under Win32 because
 *				of the lack of an int32_t datatype.  Fixed.
 *		03/30/09 RSB	Moved Downlink local static variable from
 *				CpuWriteIO() to agc_t, trying to overcome the
 *				lack of resumption of telemetry after an AGC
 *				resumption in Windows.
 *		07/17/16 RSB	Commented out a variable that wasn't being
 *				used but was generating compiler warnings.
 *		08/31/16 MAS	Corrected implementation of DINC and TIME6.
 *				DINC now uses AddSP16() to do its math. T6RUPT
 *				can only be triggered by a ZOUT from DINC. TIME6
 *				only counts when enabled, and is disabled upon
 *				triggering T6RUPT.
 *		09/08/16 MAS	Added a special case for DV -- when the dividend
 *				is 0 and the divisor is not, the quotient and
 *				remainder are both 0 with the sign matching the
 *				dividend.
 *		09/11/16 MAS	Applied Gergo's fix for multi-MCT instructions
 *				taking a cycle longer than they should.
 *		09/30/16 MAS	Added emulation of the Night Watchman, TC Trap,
 *		                and Rupt Lock hardware alarms, alarm-generated 
 *		                resets, and the CH77 restart monitor module.
 *		10/01/16 RSB	Moved location of "int ExecutedTC = 0" to the
 *				top of the function, since it triggered compiler
 *				warnings (and hence errors) for me.  (The
 *				"goto AllDone" jumped over it, leaving
 *				ExecutedTC potentially uninitialized.)
 *		10/01/16 MAS	Added a corner case to one of DV's corner cases
 *				(0 / 0), made CCS consider overflow before the
 *				diminished absolute value calculation, changed
 *				how interrupt priorities are handled, and
 *				corrected ZRUPT to be return addr+1.
 *				Aurora 12 now passes all of SELFCHK in yaAGC.
 *		10/04/16 MAS	Added support for standby mode, added the
 *				standby light to the light test, and fixed
 *				the speed of scaler counting and phasing of
 *				TIME6.
 *		11/12/16 MAS	Stopped preventing interrupts on Q and L
 *				overflow (only A overflow should do so). This
 *				was causing the O-UFLOW check in Validation
 *				to never allow interrupts, triggering a rupt
 *				lock alarm.
 *		11/12/16 MAS	Apparently CH11 bit 10 only turns off RESTART
 *				*on write*, with the actual value of the
 *				channel being otherwise  meaningless.
 *		12/19/16 MAS	Corrected one more bug in the DV instruction;
 *				the case of a number being divided by itself
 *				was not sign-extending the result in the L
 *				register. The overflow correction of the L
 *				register was then destroying the calculated
 *				sign. This was caught by Retread; apparently
 *				Aurora doesn't test for it.
 *		12/22/16 MAS	Fixed the No TC hardware alarm, discovered
 *				to be erroneously counting EXTENDS by
 *				BOREALIS.
 *		01/04/17 MAS	Added parity fail alarms caused by accessing
 *				nonexistent superbanks. There's still no way
 *				to get an erasable parity fail, because I
 *				haven't come up with a program that can cause
 *				one to happen.
 *		01/08/17 MAS	Corrected behavior of the EDRUPT instruction
 *				(it really is just a generic interrupt request).
 *				Along the way, re-enabled BRUPT substitution by
 *				default and allowed interrupts to happen after
 *				INDEXes.
 *		01/29/17 MAS	Hard-wired the DKSY's RSET button to turning
 *				off the RESTART light (the button had its
 *				own discrete to reset the RESTART flip flop
 *				in the real AGC/DSKY).
 *		01/30/17 MAS	Added parity bit checking for fixed memory
 *				when running with a ROM that contains
 *				parity bits.
 *		03/09/17 MAS	Prevented yaAGC from exiting standby if PRO is
 *				still held down from entry to standby. Also
 *				corrected turning off of RESTART, and in the
 *				process improved DSKY light latency. Last,
 *				added a new channel 163 bit that indicates
 *				power for the DSKY EL panel is switched off.
 *		03/11/17 MAS	Further improved DSKY light responsiveness,
 *				and split the logic out to its own function
 *				as a bit of housekeeping.
 *		03/26/17 MAS	Made several previously-static things a part
 *				of the agc_t state structure, which should
 *				make integration easier for simulator
 *				integrators.
 *		03/27/17 MAS	Fixed parity checking for superbanks, and added
 *				simulation of the Night Watchman's assertion of
 *				its channel 77 bit for 1.28 seconds after each
 *				triggering.
 *		04/02/17 MAS	Added simulation of a hardware bug in the
 *				design of the "No TCs" part of the TC Trap.
 *				Most causes of transients that can reset
 *				the alarm are now accounted for. Also
 *				corrected the phasing of the standby circuit
 *				and TIME1-TIME5 relative the to the scaler.
 *				With the newly corrected timer phasings,
 *				Aurora/Sunburst's self-tests cannot pass
 *				without simulation of the TC Trap bug.
 *		04/16/17 MAS	Added a simple linear model of the AGC warning
 *				filter, and added the AGC (CMC/LGC) warning
 *				light status to DSKY channel 163. Also added
 *				proper handling of the channel 33 inbit that
 *				indicates such a warning occurred.
 *		05/11/17 MAS	Moved special cases for writing to I/O channels
 *				from WriteIO into CpuWriteIO, allowing those
 *				channels to be safely written to via WriteIO
 *				by external callers (e.g. SocketAPI and NASSP).
 *		05/16/17 MAS	Made alarm restarts enable interrupts.
 *		07/13/17 MAS	Added simulation of HANDRUPT, as generated by
 *				any of three traps, which monitor various bits
 *				in channels 31 and 32.
 *		08/19/17 MAS	Made GOJAMs clear all pending interrupt requests,
 *				as well as a bunch of output channels and one
 *				input bit. Not doing so was preventing the DSKY
 *				RESTART light from working in Colossus 249 and
 *				all later CMC versions.
 *		09/03/17 MAS	Slightly tweaked handling of Z, so (as before)
 *				higher order bits typically disappear, but
 *				(newly) are visible if you're clever with
 *				use of ZRUPT. Also, made GOJAMs transfer the
 *				Z register value to Q on restart, which makes
 *				the RSBBQ erasables in Colossus/Luminary work.
 *		09/04/17 MAS	Extended emulation of DV to properly handle all
 *				off-nominal situations, including overflow in
 *				the divisor as well as all situations that create
 *				"total nonsense" as described by Savage&Drake
 *				(we previously simply returned random values).
 *		09/27/17 MAS	Fixed standby, which was broken by the GOJAM
 *				update. All I/O channels are held in their reset
 *				state via an ever-present GOJAM during standby,
 *				but the standby enabled bit (CH13 bit 11) is not
 *				required to be set to exit standby, only to enter.
 *		01/06/18 MAS	Added a new channel 163 bit for the TEMP light,
 *				which is the logical OR of channel 11 bit 4 and
 *				channel 30 bit 15. The AGC did this internally
 *				so the light would still work in standby.

 * The technical documentation for the Apollo Guidance & Navigation (G&N) system,
 * or more particularly for the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) may be found at
 * http://hrst.mit.edu/hrs/apollo/public.  That is, to the extent that the
 * documentation exists online it may be found there.  I'm sure -- or rather
 * HOPE -- that there's more documentation at NASA and MIT than has been made
 * available yet.  I personally had no knowledge of the AGC, other than what
 * I had seen in the movie "Apollo 13" and the HBO series "From the Earth to
 * the Moon", before I conceived this project last night at midnight and
 * started doing web searches.  So, bear with me; it's a learning experience!
 *
 * Also at hrst.mit.edu are the actual programs for the Command Module (CM) and
 * Lunar Module (LM) AGCs.  Or rather, what's there are scans of 1700-page
 * printouts of assembly-language listings of SOME versions of those programs.
 * (Respectively, called "Colossus" and "Luminary".)  I'll worry about how to
 * get those into a usable version only after I get the CPU simulator working!
 *
 * What THIS file contains is basically a pure simulation of the CPU, without any
 * input and output as such.  (I/O, to the DSKY or to CM or LM hardware
 * simulations occurs through the mechanism of sockets, and hence the DSKY
 * front-end and hardware back-end simulations may be implemented as complete
 * stand-alone programs and replaced at will.)  There is a single globally
 * interesting function, called agc_engine, which is intended to be called once
 * per AGC instruction cycle -- i.e., every 11.7 microseconds.  (Yes, that's
 * right, the CPU clock speed was a little over 85 KILOhertz.  That's a factor
 * that obviously makes the simulation much easier!)  The function may be called
 * more or less often than this, to speed up or slow down the apparent passage
 * of time.
 *
 * This function is intended to be completely portable, so that it may be run in
 * a PC environment (Microsoft Windows) or in any *NIX environment, or indeed in
 * an embedded target if anybody should wish to create an actual physical
 * replacement for an AGC.  Also, multiple copies of the simulation may be run
 * on the same PC -- for example to simulation a CM and LM simultaneously.

// The case of PCDU or MCDU triggers being applied to the CDUX,Y,Z counters
// presents a special problem.  The AGC expects these triggers to be 
// applied at a certain fixed rate.  The DAP portion of Luminary or Colossus
// applies a digital filter to the counts, in order to eliminate electrical
// noise, as well as noise caused by vibration of the spacecraft.  Therefore,
// if the simulated IMU applies PCDU/MCDU triggers too fast, the digital
// filter in the DAP will simply reject the count, and therefore the spacecraft's
// orientation cannot be measured by the DAP.  Consequently, we have to 
// fake up a kind of FIFO on the triggers to the CDUX,Y,Z counters so that
// we can increment or decrement the counters at no more than the fixed rate.
// (Conversely, of course, the simulated IMU has to be able to supply the 
// triggers *at least* as fast as the fixed rate.)
//
// Actually, there are two different fixed rates for PCDU/MCDU:  400 counts
// per second in "slow mode", and 6400 counts per second in "fast mode".
//
// *** FIXME! All of the following junk will need to move to agc_t, and will
//     somehow have to be made compatible with backtraces. ***
// The way the FIFO works is that it can hold an ordered set of + counts and
// - counts.  For example, if it held 7,-5,10, it would mean to apply 7 PCDUs,
// followed by 5 MCDUs, followed by 10 PCDUs.  If there are too many sign-changes
// buffered, triggers will be transparently dropped.
